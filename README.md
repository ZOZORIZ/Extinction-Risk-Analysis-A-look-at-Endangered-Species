# Extinction Risk Analysis of Endangered Animals

This project uses real-world-inspired data to perform exploratory data analysis on animals close to extinction using *Pandas, **NumPy, and **Matplotlib*.

## Dataset Columns
- Name: Species name
- Category: Type of species (e.g., Mammal, Reptile, Bird, etc.)
- Status: Extinction risk in percentage (0–100)
- Habitat: Natural habitat of the species

## Visualizations

### 1. Top 5 Most Endangered Animals
- Bar graph showing the species with the highest extinction percentage.

### 2. Species Count by Category
- Count of animals grouped by type (Mammals, Reptiles, etc.).

### 3. Habitat Distribution
- Pie chart showing how habitats are distributed across species.

### 4. Average Extinction Risk by Habitat
- Bar chart replacing the boxplot for clarity.
